Problem:
    Whenever a student's exam was entered and it wasnt exactly the same as the answer key, the student was given 0% (an F)
Solution:
    Score algorithm was repaired by having a second for loop for tests with lengths less than the actual exam.  In primary for loop the same algorithm was applied.

Problem:
    Program crashes after student data is entered.
Solution:
    Localize a global variable inside of member functions instead of one global variable.
    
Problem:
    Application crashes after data was entered/
    Due to array not initialized properly (with zero sieze)
Solution:
    Set a global array size to allocate space, and then use limit to only edit a portion of the actual array.
